INTRODUCTION
Library Management system is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, strings, classes have been used for the development of it. To store the data, it uses C++ OOPs and file handling concept. This project provides the best system for managing library records. In this project, we are creating two classes Students and books.
The project has the following features based on which our program is built:
•	Login
•	Book issue

•	Display book details
•	Show the details of a student
•	Modifying student record

•	Calculating fine for late book return
                                 OBJECTIVES

2. We developed it user-friendly
3.We developed it computer-based system thatreduces error 
4. We have made it efficient in handling the records of so many students and books which is manually impossible
